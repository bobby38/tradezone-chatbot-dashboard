### Browser DevTools Check
1. **Network Tab**: Verify uploads to Appwrite succeed (200 status)
2. **Console**: No JavaScript errors
3. **Application > Local Storage**: Session ID stored
4. **Performance**: Image loads from CDN (fast)

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Image upload fails
**Check:**
- Appwrite API key in Coolify environment
- Bucket permissions set to public read
- File size under limit (check Appwrite bucket settings)

**Fix:**
- Verify env vars: `APPWRITE_API_KEY` exists
- Check API response in Network tab
- Falls back to base64 automatically

### Issue: Voice tools don't execute
**Check:**
- Console shows `[Tool] Executing: ...`
- Tools configured in `/api/chatkit/realtime`
- API endpoints responding

**Fix:**
- Check OpenAI API key is valid
- Verify tools array in session config
- Check `/api/tools/perplexity` endpoint

### Issue: Mobile overflow
**Check:**
- CSS using `100dvh` not `100vh`
- Body has `tz-widget-open` class when open
- No transform on mobile media query

**Fix:**
- Clear browser cache
- Force refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check responsive mode in DevTools
