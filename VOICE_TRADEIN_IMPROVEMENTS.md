# Voice Trade-In & Email Improvements

**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Overview

Enhanced the voice chat system with complete trade-in workflow support, email fallback mechanisms, and dashboard integration for all agent-sent emails.

---

## üéØ Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Microphone Button UI** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Microphone button became oval instead of staying circular during voice chat.

**Solution:** Added fixed dimensions with `aspect-ratio: 1/1` CSS and proper flexbox centering.

**File:** `components/realtime-voice.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added pulsing animation ring around microphone
- Fixed circular button with `w-24 h-24` and `aspect-square`
- Added hover scale effect
- Improved visual hierarchy with gradient background

**Result:** Microphone button now stays perfectly circular and has better visual feedback.

### 2. **Trade-In Workflow in Voice Mode** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Voice chat didn't have trade-in tools (`tradein_update_lead`, `tradein_submit_lead`).

**Solution:** Integrated full trade-in workflow from `lib/chatkit/tradeInPrompts.ts`.

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/chatkit/realtime/route.ts` - Import trade-in prompts and tools
- `components/realtime-voice.tsx` - Add trade-in tool handlers
- `lib/chatkit/tradeInPrompts.ts` - Shared prompts for text and voice

**New Features:**
- `tradein_update_lead` - Save trade-in data immediately after each user response
- `tradein_submit_lead` - Submit final trade-in and trigger email notification
- Automatic lead creation via `sessionId`

**Trade-In Flow:**
1. User mentions device ‚Üí Agent quotes price range
2. Agent asks max 2 questions (condition, accessories, payout method)
3. Agent saves data **immediately** with `tradein_update_lead`
4. Photos optional - "Add Photo" suggested but not required
5. When contact + device confirmed ‚Üí `tradein_submit_lead`
6. Email sent to staff (`info@rezult.co` or `STAFF_EMAIL`)
7. Customer receives confirmation

**System Prompt:** Now includes complete trade-in playbook with "SAVE IMMEDIATELY" protocol.

---

### 3. **Email Fallback for Unanswerable Questions** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** When agent can't answer, it had no way to collect contact and escalate to staff.

**Solution:** Added "Fallback Protocol" to voice instructions.

**File:** `lib/chatkit/tradeInPrompts.ts`

**New Behavior:**
```
User: "Do you have warranty extension for Xbox?"
Agent: (searches, finds nothing)
Agent: "I don't have that information right now, but I can have our team get back to you. What's your name and email?"
User: "Bobby, bobby@example.com"
Agent: Uses sendemail tool with emailType="info_request"
Agent: "I've sent your question to our team. They'll email you within 24 hours."
```

**When to Use:**
- Can't find answer after using searchProducts or searchtool
- Customer asks highly specific question outside knowledge base
- Customer explicitly requests staff follow-up

---

### 4. **Email API Enhanced with ChatKit Support** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Email API only accepted raw email format, not ChatKit tool format.

**Solution:** Updated to handle both ChatKit tool calls and legacy email format.

**File:** `app/api/tools/email/route.ts`

**New Features:**
- Accepts `{ emailType, name, email, phone_number, message }` format
- Auto-generates appropriate subject and HTML based on `emailType`:
  - `trade_in` ‚Üí "üîÑ Trade-In Request from [Name]"
  - `info_request` ‚Üí "‚ÑπÔ∏è Information Request from [Name]"
  - `contact` ‚Üí "üìß Contact Request from [Name]"
- Sets `replyTo` to customer email for easy staff response
- Sends to `STAFF_EMAIL` env var (defaults to `info@rezult.co`)

**Email Format:**
```html
<h2>Customer Information Request (Voice Chat)</h2>
<p><strong>Customer:</strong> Bobby</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> bobby@example.com</p>
<p><strong>Phone:</strong> +65 1234 5678</p>
<h3>Question:</h3>
<p>Do you have warranty extension for Xbox?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Amara couldn't answer this question - customer needs staff follow-up.</em></p>
```

---

### 5. **Dashboard Submissions Integration** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Agent emails didn't appear in `/dashboard/submissions` page.

**Solution:** Email API now creates submission record with `content_type: "Agent"`.

**File:** `app/api/tools/email/route.ts`

**New Behavior:**
- After sending email, creates entry in `submissions` table
- `content_type: "Agent"` (instead of "Contact Form")
- `source: "chatkit_voice"`
- `status: "unread"`
- `ai_metadata` includes:
  - `email_type` (trade_in, info_request, contact)
  - `phone` (customer phone)
  - `sent_via: "voice_assistant"`
  - `timestamp`

**Result:** All agent-sent emails now visible at `/dashboard/submissions` with "Agent" label.

---

### 6. **Trade-In APIs Accept sessionId** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Voice chat only has `sessionId`, but trade-in APIs required `leadId`.

**Solution:** Updated APIs to accept `sessionId` and auto-lookup or create lead.

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/tradein/update/route.ts`
- `app/api/tradein/submit/route.ts`

**New Behavior:**

**Update API:**
```typescript
POST /api/tradein/update
{
  "sessionId": "Guest-1234",  // No leadId needed!
  "brand": "Sony",
  "model": "PlayStation 5",
  "storage": "1TB"
}
```
- If no lead exists ‚Üí Creates new lead via `ensureTradeInLead()`
- If lead exists ‚Üí Updates existing lead
- Returns `{ success: true, lead }`

**Submit API:**
```typescript
POST /api/tradein/submit
{
  "sessionId": "Guest-1234",  // No leadId needed!
  "summary": "PS5 1TB trade-in",
  "notify": true
}
```
- Looks up lead by `session_id`
- Submits lead and sends email notification
- Returns `{ success: true, lead, emailSent }`
