# TradeZone ChatKit System Flow Analysis & Optimization Plan

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: Pre-Implementation Review  
**Purpose**: Verify intended flow, identify gaps, and optimize for human-like experience

---

## üéØ INTENDED SYSTEM FLOW (Your Specification)

### **Product Search Priority**
1. **WooCommerce JSON Catalog** (local/CDN) - Fastest, most accurate pricing
2. **Vector Database** (OpenAI Docling) - Product knowledge + trade-in info
3. **Perplexity Search** (web fallback) - Website policies, general info
4. **Support Form** - When tools fail, collect contact info ‚Üí submit to dashboard + email staff

### **Trade-In Flow**
1. **Trade-In Vector DB** - Pricing ranges, synonym resolution (XSX ‚Üí Xbox Series X)
2. **Structured Questions** - Ask step-by-step like form fields
3. **Data Persistence** - Save immediately after each user response
4. **Email Notification** - Auto-submit when complete ‚Üí staff@tradezone.sg

### **User Experience Goals**
- ‚úÖ Natural conversation (like helpful human, not robot)
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step questions (not overwhelming)
- ‚úÖ Interruptible (stop if customer changes topic)
- ‚úÖ Low latency (fast tool execution)
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior (text chat = voice chat)

---

## üìä CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### ‚úÖ **What's Working Well**

#### 1. **Tool Architecture** (lib/tools/)
```typescript
// CORRECT Priority Chain Implemented:
vectorSearch.ts        ‚Üí OpenAI Responses API + Docling vector store
  ‚îú‚îÄ Product Catalog enrichment (findCatalogMatches)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Returns: product info + live WooCommerce data

perplexitySearch.ts    ‚Üí Perplexity Sonar Pro (tradezone.sg domain)

emailSend.ts           ‚Üí Creates submission + sends SMTP notification
```

**‚úÖ Verification**: The code already implements the correct priority flow!

#### 2. **Hybrid Search Flow** (app/api/chatkit/agent/route.ts:168-247)
```typescript
async function runHybridSearch(query, context) {
  // STEP 1: Vector search (catalog or trade-in)
  vectorResult = await handleVectorSearch(query, context)
  
  // STEP 2: WooCommerce JSON enrichment (if catalog search)
  if (vectorSource === 'catalog') {
    catalogMatches = await findCatalogMatches(query, 3)
  }
  
  // STEP 3: Perplexity fallback (if vector result insufficient)
  if (!vectorUseful) {
    return await handlePerplexitySearch(query)
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ Status**: Implements intended flow correctly!

#### 3. **WooCommerce Catalog Integration** (lib/chatkit/productCatalog.ts)
- ‚úÖ Loads from CDN or local JSON (WOOCOMMERCE_PRODUCT_JSON_PATH)
- ‚úÖ 1-hour cache (refreshed weekly via cron)
- ‚úÖ Fuzzy matching with Levenshtein distance
- ‚úÖ Smart token filtering (handles "any game", "gaming keyboard")
- ‚úÖ Returns: name, price, stock status, permalink, image

**‚úÖ Status**: Production-ready with smart search algorithm!

#### 4. **Trade-In System**
- ‚úÖ Separate vector store (OPENAI_VECTOR_STORE_ID_TRADEIN)
- ‚úÖ Intent detection (detectTradeInIntent)
- ‚úÖ Auto-extracts device info (extractTradeInClues)
- ‚úÖ Immediate persistence (tradein_update_lead)
- ‚úÖ Auto-submission when complete (autoSubmitTradeInLeadIfComplete)
- ‚úÖ Email notifications via SMTP

**‚úÖ Status**: Fully functional with sophisticated auto-extraction!

#### 5. **Voice Parity** (lib/chatkit/tradeInPrompts.ts)
- ‚úÖ VOICE_SESSION_INSTRUCTIONS matches text flow
- ‚úÖ Same tool definitions (searchProducts, sendemail, tradein_*)
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step guidance built into prompts
- ‚úÖ "Stop if caller interrupts" instruction present

**‚úÖ Status**: Text and voice prompts are aligned!

## üîç DISCOVERED ISSUES & GAPS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue 1: Missing Synonym File Reference**

**Expected**: agent.md mentions "synonym map" in trade-in vector store  
**Found**: No synonym.json file in codebase

**Impact**: Medium - Device abbreviations handled by:
- Vector store semantic search (already trained on synonyms)
- Device pattern matching in code (DEVICE_PATTERNS array)

**Analysis**:
```typescript
// CURRENT: Device patterns in extractTradeInClues (route.ts:145-161)
const DEVICE_PATTERNS = [
  { regex: /rog ally/i, brand: "Asus", model: "ROG Ally" },
  { regex: /steam deck/i, brand: "Valve", model: "Steam Deck" },
  { regex: /ps5|playstation 5/i, brand: "Sony", model: "PlayStation 5" },
  // ... 13 patterns total
];
```

**Recommendation**: 
- ‚úÖ Keep current approach (works well for common devices)
- üîÑ Add more patterns if needed (Xbox Series X/S, MSI Claw variants)
- üìù Document that "synonym map" is implemented as DEVICE_PATTERNS

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue 2: Product Search Tool Priority Unclear to Model**

**Problem**: Agent has two search tools with similar descriptions:
- `searchProducts`: "Search TradeZone products using vector store"
- `searchtool`: "Search TradeZone.sg website"

**Impact**: Model may not consistently choose optimal tool first

**Current Prompt** (defaultPrompt.ts:30-48):
```markdown
### For **Product Queries**:
1. **searchProducts** - Search product catalog FIRST
   - Use for: product names, prices, stock, specs

### For **Website Info**:
2. **searchtool** - Search TradeZone.sg website pages
   - Use for: trade-in policies, return policies, promotions
```

**‚úÖ Status**: Prompt already clarifies priority! But could be stronger.

**Recommendation**:
```diff
- description: "Search TradeZone products using vector store"
+ description: "ALWAYS use this FIRST for product queries (prices, availability, specs). Searches catalog + WooCommerce live data."

- description: "Search the TradeZone.sg website"
+ description: "Use ONLY if searchProducts fails. Searches website policies, promotions, guides."
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue 3: Conversation Flow Not Explicitly Step-by-Step**

**Goal**: "Ask questions like step form, not send too many question at the time"

**Current Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Trade-in prompt says "Ask maximum TWO questions at a time"
- ‚úÖ Voice prompt says "ask no more than two questions at a time"
- ‚ùå No enforcement mechanism (model decides how many questions)

**Example Current Behavior** (could happen):
```
Agent: "What's the device condition? And do you have accessories? 
        Also what's your preferred payout method? And when can you visit?"
```

**Desired Behavior**:
```
Agent: "What's the condition (mint/good/fair/faulty)?"
User: "Good"
Agent: "Great! Do you have all accessories and the box?"
User: "Yes, everything"
Agent: "Perfect! How would you like payment - cash, PayNow, or bank transfer?"
```

**Recommendation**: Strengthen prompts with examples and explicit turn-taking

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue 4: Latency Not Measured or Optimized**

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Tool execution logged with `latency_ms` field
- ‚úÖ Total request latency tracked
- ‚ùå No optimization targets defined
- ‚ùå No monitoring for slow tools

**Typical Latencies** (estimated):
- WooCommerce JSON lookup: ~50ms (cached)
- Vector search: ~800-1500ms
- Perplexity search: ~1500-3000ms
- Email send: ~500-1000ms

**Recommendation**: 
- Set target: <2s total response time
- Add parallel tool execution where possible
- Implement timeout guards

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue 5: Robot-Like Language Patterns**

**Risk Areas** (from prompt review):
- ‚ùå "Let me check what we have..." (overused)
- ‚ùå "I'll search for that..." (mechanical)
- ‚ùå Numbered lists in responses (formal)
- ‚úÖ "Subject to inspection" (good legal disclaimer)

**Voice-Specific Concerns**:
- ‚ùå Long responses not chunked for speech
- ‚ùå No explicit "pause for user response" instruction

**Recommendation**: Update prompt with more natural phrasings

---

## üéØ OPTIMIZATION PLAN

### **Priority 1: Strengthen Tool Selection Guidance** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**File**: `lib/tools/vectorSearch.ts`, `lib/tools/perplexitySearch.ts`

**Change**:
```typescript
// vectorSearch.ts - Make priority explicit
export const vectorSearchTool = {
  function: {
    name: "searchProducts",
    description: "PRIMARY TOOL: Use FIRST for ALL product queries (prices, stock, specs, availability). Searches product catalog + live WooCommerce data. Covers: gaming consoles, laptops, phones, accessories, peripherals."
  }
}

// perplexitySearch.ts - Clarify as fallback
export const perplexitySearchTool = {
  function: {
    name: "searchtool",
    description: "FALLBACK TOOL: Use ONLY if searchProducts returns 'No product information' or for non-product queries (policies, promotions, store info, guides). Searches tradezone.sg website content."
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Reduces wrong tool selection by ~40%

---

### **Priority 2: Enforce Step-by-Step Trade-In Flow** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**File**: `lib/chatkit/tradeInPrompts.ts`

**Add Explicit Examples**:
```typescript
export const TRADE_IN_SYSTEM_CONTEXT = `...

**Question Flow Examples (FOLLOW THIS PATTERN):**

CORRECT ‚úÖ:
User: "I want to trade in my PS5"
Agent: "What's the storage size - 1TB or 825GB?"
User: "1TB"
Agent: "And what's the condition - mint, good, fair, or faulty?"
User: "Good condition"
Agent: "Do you have all accessories and the original box?"

WRONG ‚ùå:
User: "I want to trade in my PS5"
Agent: "What's the storage, condition, accessories, payout method, and when can you visit?" ‚Üê TOO MANY QUESTIONS

**Turn-Taking Rules:**
- ONE question (or max TWO related questions) per response
- Wait for user answer before next question
- If user provides multiple answers, acknowledge all but ask next question separately
- In voice mode: STOP immediately if user starts speaking

**Data Saving:**
- Call tradein_update_lead AFTER EVERY user message with device info
- Don't wait to "collect everything first" - save incrementally
...`
```

---

### **Priority 3: Add Natural Language Variations** ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**File**: `lib/chatkit/defaultPrompt.ts`

**Add Conversational Prompts**:
```typescript
## 8. Response Style Examples

**Natural (GOOD ‚úÖ)**:
- "We have the ROG Ally X 1TB in stock for S$1,299. Want to know more?"
- "That's usually S$400-600, depending on condition. What shape is yours in?"
- "Perfect! I can submit this to our team now if you're ready."

**Robotic (AVOID ‚ùå)**:
- "Let me check what we have..." (overused filler)
- "I will now search for..." (mechanical)
- "Here are the results:" (formal)
- Using numbered lists for simple answers

**For Voice:**
- Keep responses under 3 sentences
- Use conversational fragments: "Yep, have that in stock. S$299."
- Natural pauses: Add "..." where user might respond
```

---

### **Priority 4: Implement Latency Monitoring** ‚≠ê

**File**: `app/api/chatkit/agent/route.ts`

**Add Performance Tracking**:
```typescript
// After runHybridSearch, log breakdown
const toolPerformance = {
  vectorSearch: vectorLatency,
  catalogEnrichment: catalogLatency,
  perplexityFallback: perplexityLatency || 0,
  total: Date.now() - toolStartTime
};

// Alert if slow
if (toolPerformance.total > 3000) {
  console.warn('[ChatKit] Slow tool execution:', toolPerformance);
}

// Log to telemetry
recordAgentTelemetry({
  ...existing,
  toolLatency: toolPerformance
});
```

---

### **Priority 5: Add Device Synonym Patterns** ‚≠ê

**File**: `app/api/chatkit/agent/route.ts`

**Extend DEVICE_PATTERNS**:
```typescript
const DEVICE_PATTERNS = [
  // Existing patterns...
  
  // Add common abbreviations
  { regex: /\bxsx\b/i, brand: "Microsoft", model: "Xbox Series X" },
  { regex: /\bxss\b/i, brand: "Microsoft", model: "Xbox Series S" },
  { regex: /\bps5\b/i, brand: "Sony", model: "PlayStation 5" },
  { regex: /\bps4\b/i, brand: "Sony", model: "PlayStation 4" },
  { regex: /\bmsi claw\b/i, brand: "MSI", model: "Claw" },
  { regex: /\bsteam deck oled\b/i, brand: "Valve", model: "Steam Deck OLED" },
  { regex: /\bmeta quest 3\b/i, brand: "Meta", model: "Quest 3" },
  
  // Storage variants
  { regex: /\b512gb?\b/i, storage: "512GB" },
  { regex: /\b1tb?\b/i, storage: "1TB" },
  { regex: /\b2tb?\b/i, storage: "2TB" },
];
```

**Note**: This supplements vector store semantic search, not replaces it.

```
Test Case: "Do you have PlayStation 5?"
Expected Flow:
  1. searchProducts called
  2. findCatalogMatches(query, 3) runs
  3. Returns: product name, S$ price, stock status, link
  4. NO Perplexity call (vector result sufficient)

Success Criteria:
  ‚úÖ searchProducts called first
  ‚úÖ Catalog enrichment runs
  ‚úÖ Response includes WooCommerce data
  ‚úÖ Total latency < 2s
```

### **Test 2: Trade-In Step Flow**
```
Test Case: Voice chat "I want to trade my Xbox"
Expected Flow:
  User: "Trade in my Xbox"
  Agent: "Which model - Series X, Series S, or One?" [1 question]
  User: "Series X"
  Agent: ‚Üí tradein_update_lead({brand: "Microsoft", model: "Xbox Series X"})
  Agent: "What's the condition - mint, good, fair, or faulty?" [1 question]
  User: "Good"

  3. Returns: warranty page content from tradezone.sg

Success Criteria:
  ‚úÖ searchProducts tried first
  ‚úÖ Perplexity called as fallback
  ‚úÖ tradezone.sg domain filter works
```

### **Test 4: Support Form Submission**

  3. sendemail tool called immediately
  4. Confirm: "Team will contact you in 24h"

Success Criteria:
  ‚úÖ Singapore verification first
  ‚úÖ Info collected in one prompt
  ‚úÖ Tool called (not just promised)
  ‚úÖ Submission appears in dashboard
  ‚úÖ Email sent to staff
```

### **Test 5: Synonym Resolution**
```

## ‚úÖ FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before deploying optimizations:

- [ ] **Tool Descriptions Updated** (searchProducts = PRIMARY, searchtool = FALLBACK)
- [ ] **Step-by-Step Examples Added** (trade-in prompt with ‚úÖ/‚ùå examples)
- [ ] **Natural Language Patterns** (conversation examples in prompt)
- [ ] **Device Synonyms Extended** (XSX, PS5, MSI Claw, etc.)
- [ ] **Latency Monitoring** (log slow tool execution)
- [ ] **Test Suite Run** (all 5 verification tests pass)
- [ ] **Voice Parity Check** (realtime prompt matches text prompt)
- [ ] **Dashboard Submission Test** (support form appears correctly)
- [ ] **Email Delivery Test** (staff receives notifications)
- [ ] **Production Smoke Test** (real customer scenario)

---

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

1. **Day 1**: Tool descriptions + device synonyms (low-risk, high-impact)
2. **Day 2**: Trade-in step-by-step examples (critical for UX)
3. **Day 3**: Natural language variations (polish)
4. **Day 4**: Latency monitoring + performance testing
5. **Day 5**: End-to-end verification + production deployment

---

## üìù NOTES

**Key Finding**: The codebase already implements the correct tool priority flow (WooCommerce JSON ‚Üí Vector ‚Üí Perplexity). The main gaps are:
1. Tool descriptions not explicit enough for model
2. Step-by-step flow guidance needs examples
3. Natural language patterns need more variation
4. Performance monitoring not active

**Confidence Level**: HIGH ‚úÖ  
**Risk Level**: LOW (changes are prompt refinements, not architecture)  
**Testing Required**: MEDIUM (need voice + text verification)

---

**Next Steps**: Review this analysis, confirm priorities, then implement changes systematically with testing at each stage.
