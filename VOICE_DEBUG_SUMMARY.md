# Voice Debug Summary - Systematic Tracking

## ‚úÖ WHAT WORKS (Dashboard)
- Dashboard voice chat works perfectly
- Uses `/components/realtime-voice.tsx`
- Audio plays back successfully
- Transcription appears

## ‚ùå WHAT DOESN'T WORK (Widget)
- Widget voice connects but NO AUDIO plays
- Been broken for 3+ hours
- User has tested multiple times

## üîç ROOT CAUSE FOUND

### Dashboard Implementation (WORKING)
```javascript
// Line 44-46 in realtime-voice.tsx
const ws = new WebSocket(
  `${config.config.websocketUrl}?model=${config.config.model}`,
  ["realtime", `openai-insecure-api-key.${config.config.apiKey}`, "openai-beta.realtime-v1"]
);

// Line 88-96 - Has turn detection
input_audio_transcription: {
  model: "whisper-1",
},
turn_detection: {
  type: "server_vad",
  threshold: 0.5,
  prefix_padding_ms: 300,
  silence_duration_ms: 200,
}
```

### Widget Implementation (BROKEN - NOW FIXED)
```javascript
// OLD (WRONG):
this.ws = new WebSocket(
  'wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime',  // ‚ùå Wrong URL
  ['realtime', `openai-insecure-api-key.${config.config.apiKey}`, 'openai-beta.realtime-v1']
);
// ‚ùå Missing turn_detection
// ‚ùå Missing input_audio_transcription

// NEW (FIXED):
this.ws = new WebSocket(
  `${config.config.websocketUrl}?model=${config.config.model}`,  // ‚úÖ Correct
  ['realtime', `openai-insecure-api-key.${config.config.apiKey}`, 'openai-beta.realtime-v1']
);
// ‚úÖ Added turn_detection
// ‚úÖ Added input_audio_transcription
```

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

### Code Changes Made
- [x] Updated WebSocket URL to match dashboard
- [x] Added input_audio_transcription
- [x] Added turn_detection (server_vad)
- [x] Added comprehensive logging
- [x] Fixed video URL
- [x] Fixed transcript background

### Testing Status
- [ ] **NEEDS TESTING** - Reload page and test voice
- [ ] Check console for new logs
- [ ] Verify audio plays
- [ ] Confirm transcription works

## üéØ EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT (After Fix)

When voice works correctly, you should see:
```
[Voice] Connected
[Voice] AudioContext initial state: running
[Voice] Audio initialized, queue size: 0
[Voice] Received event: session.created
[Voice] Received event: session.updated
[Voice] Sent 50 audio chunks to OpenAI
[Voice] Sent 100 audio chunks to OpenAI
[Voice] Received event: conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed
[Voice] Received event: response.audio.delta
[Voice] Processing audio, base64 length: XXXX
[Voice] Audio queued, total chunks: 1, samples: XXXX
[Voice] AudioContext state: running
```

## üö® IF STILL NOT WORKING

Check these in order:
1. **Reload the page** - Changes need fresh load
2. **Check console** - Look for new event logs
3. **Speak clearly** - Say "Hello, can you hear me?"
4. **Wait 2-3 seconds** - Server VAD needs time to detect speech
5. **Check for errors** - Any WebSocket errors?

## üìù NEXT STEPS

1. User reloads demo page
2. Click Voice button
3. Speak into microphone
4. Check console logs
5. Report what happens

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIME TRACKING

- Started: ~3 hours ago
- Issue: Voice connects but no audio
- Fix applied: WebSocket URL + turn detection
- Status: **WAITING FOR USER TEST**
